This is a random-number library for Lua 5.1. It is based on the Mersenne
Twister random number generator available at
	http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/MT2002/emt19937ar.html

To try the library, just edit Makefile to reflect your installation of Lua and
then run make. This will build the library and run a simple test. For detailed
installation instructions, see
	http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~lhf/ftp/lua/install.html

There is no manual but the library is simple and intuitive; see the summary
below. Read also test.lua, which shows the library in action.
